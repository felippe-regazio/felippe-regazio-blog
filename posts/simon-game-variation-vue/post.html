<p>
  Recently i made this kind of Simon Game using VueJS.
</p>

<blockquote>
  Simon is an electronic game of memory skill invented by Ralph H. Baer and Howard J. Morrison, 
  working for toy design firm Marvin Glass and Associates,[1] with software programming by Lenny Cope. 
  The device creates a series of tones and lights and requires a user to repeat the sequence.
</blockquote>

<p>
  In my implementation, the previous sequence is not memorized. Every time you hit the right sequence 
  a completely new variation with a new step is proposed by the computer. This version is also "infinite", 
  test your limits.

  Here is the game link:
