  Yep, i created my ow Express i18n Middleware for REST APIs, and published it as a npm package. It has only 16kb, 
  super easy usage, no-dependency and its well tested.
</p>

<p>
  You can check the package on that link: <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-rest-i18n">https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-rest-i18n</a>

  If you need to internationalize your REST API, you can consider use it, its FOSS. I have searching for some 
  alternatives to REST APIs Internationalization and all of them (related to Express) where intended to be very 
  general solutions, bringing a lot of built-in features that i didnt want to, or i simply disliked the API. So, 
  i decided to write my own, the smaller and simplest as possible.
</p>

<p>
  That made me think about something: The trade offs of creating very general tools VS a set of small single-purpose 
  tools. I think this concern is not new, of course. We've been trying to solve this question in some different levels 
  of development with module patterns, components, tree-shaking, graphs etc. So, this should be a packagist level question 
  also, right? When you decide to start something, maybe you should ask yourself about this (?).
</p>

<p>
  See, im not telling that the other tools i saw are bad or criticizing the options available, or telling that i created 
  a better one, is not that. I dont even consider myself a good programmer as the guys that created such awesome tools 
  like those i saw out there. My concern was purely: the weight of some modules to solve such small tasks on my project. 
  Purely a trade off. Now, im just questioning how good or how bad can be to write a general VS single-purpose solutions.
