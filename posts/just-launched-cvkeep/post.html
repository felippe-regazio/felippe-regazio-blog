<p>Im very proud and excited to have launched one of the biggest Free and Open Source projects I&#39;ve ever done.</p>
<p>CV Keep is a complete platform to keep an Online Resume, and in this post I will talk about some features and highlights of this project.</p>
<p>Here is the live platform: <a href="https://cvkeep.com">https://cvkeep.com</a></p>
<h2 id="presentation">Presentation</h2>
<p>The idea of ​​the project is that anyone can keep an online resume quickly, beautifully, easy to manage and without the hassles of having to dive into a social network (trap) just to do this. And the platform is already internationalized. My CV for ex: <a href="https://www.cvkeep.com/cv/felipperegazio">https://www.cvkeep.com/cv/felipperegazio</a></p>
<p>The project was completely done by me, end to end. At the time I wanted to study some technologies and create a SAAS from scratch.</p>
<p>Also worth to mention: <strong>This project is a FOSS - Free and Open Source Software</strong>. You can use for anything your want, download the sources, put your own service up (even for commercial use) - since you don&#39;t use the same brand, you do not owe me anything.</p>
<p>In the next lines i will talk about technical aspects of the platform. That said, here are some useful links:</p>

<h2 id="stack">Stack</h2>
<p>The project was done using a MEVN Stack: Mongo, Express, Vue and Node. It uses Vue-CLI 3 for Front End and no framework for styling.</p>
<p>Actually, the styling framework for this project was handcrafted and gave birth to a CSS Microframework made by me, and a Dev post here on DEV about SCSS architecture:</p>

<h2 id="architecture">Architecture</h2>
<p>The front talks to an independent RESTFul API, and both the Front and the API are modularized.</p>
<p>Still on the front, the project is a SPA/PWA with a service worker that delivers the app in a SUPER functional and light way, easy to convert to a mobile app.</p>
<h2 id="i18n">i18n</h2>
<p>The project is already internationalized between <code>pt-br</code> and <code>en</code>. It is very simple to translate, there is a section in the documentation dedicated to explaining how to add new languages.</p>
<p>The internationalization is independent between the Back End and Front End. In the Front I used Vue-i18n. In the Back I built an i18n lib dedicated to the project, called Express-REST-i18n, so that the API already delivers the content in the language that the front asks for based on Language headers, avoiding saving Back End matter in the front.</p>
<p>Here is the Express Rest i18n Middleware: <a href="https://github.com/felippe-regazio/express-rest-i18n">GitHub: express-rest-i18n</a></p>

<p>This project was optimized to the maximum i could do, so the cost is ridiculous. Today I run my instance with this infra:</p>
<p>A 7 dollars Heroku App A Mongo Atlas (Free Tier) A CloudFlare Free Tier</p>
<p>Other than that, I pay the annual domain. That&#39;s all the cost I have, and it&#39;s ready to scale if i need.</p>
<h2 id="thats-all">Thats all</h2>
<p>Thats all folks. Just to say that I was happy to finish the project, and I hope it can be useful to someone.</p>
