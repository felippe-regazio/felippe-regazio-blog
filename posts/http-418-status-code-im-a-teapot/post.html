<p>
  I was building an API, and consulting some http status codes when i saw the 418 status code on the MDN documentation.
</p>

<blockquote>
  418 I'm a teapot<br/>
  The server refuses the attempt to brew coffee with a teapot.
</blockquote>

<p>
  And this is what the MDN says about it:
</p>

<blockquote>
  The HTTP 418 I'm a teapot client error response code indicates that the server refuses to brew coffee because it 
  is a teapot. This error is a reference to Hyper Text Coffee Pot Control Protocol which was an April Fools' joke in 1998.

<p>
  You can check the documentation <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status">Here</a>
</p>

<p>
  And here is the RFC <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2324#section-2.3.2">Here</a>
</p>

<p>
  Then i asked myself: WTF?
</p>

<p>
  Most of you devs may already known this staus code and even its history, but many dont. So, there it goes:
</p>

<blockquote>
  "So, what's the "418 I'm a teapot" all about? Well, the group of people who make these codes and set the standards 
  is the IETF or "Internet Engineering Task Force". To propose new standards, the members release RFC's or "Requests 
  for Comments" to the community. Every year since 1989, they release a few humorous RFC's for April's Fool Day and 
  on April 1st, 1998, RFC 2324 introduced the "Hyper Text Coffee Pot Control Protocol" or (HTCPCP/1.0). This was a 
  brand new protocol for controlling, monitoring, and diagnosing coffee pots. Now, the RFC is pretty funny with lines 
  like "Coffee pots heat water using electronic mechanisms, so there is no fire. (...) Now, you may be asking, if 
  this is a COFFEE protocol, why the "teapot" code? This is answered in Section 2.3.2. in that "Any attempt to brew 
  coffee with a teapot should result in the HTTP error code 418 I'm a teapot and the resulting entity body MAY be 
  short and stout". And just like that the "418 I'm a teapot" code was born! Since then, it's been used in all sorts 
  of wacky ways. Google even referred to "418" as a different error in their 2013 April Fool's Joke "Google Nose" 
  saying that "418: Scent transfer protocol error" indicates system congestion; please try again later".

<p>
  So, its just a joke.

<p>
  Personally, i found it very cool ;P
