  <h2>The Two Aspects</h2>
  <p>Below the surface of the machine, the program moves. Without effort, it expands and contracts. In great harmony, electrons scatter and<br>
  regroup. The forms on the monitor are but ripples on the water. The essence stays invisibly below.&nbsp;When the creators built the machine, they put in the processor and the<br>
  memory. From these arise the two aspects of the program.&nbsp;The aspect of the processor is the active substance. It is called&nbsp;Control.</p>
  <p>The aspect of the memory is the passive substance. It is&nbsp;called Data.</p>
  <p>Data is made of merely bits, yet it takes complex forms. Control&nbsp;consists only of simple instructions, yet it performs difficult&nbsp;tasks. From the small and trivial, the large and complex arise.</p>
  <p>The program source is Data. Control arises from it. The Control&nbsp;proceeds to create new Data. The one is born from the other, the&nbsp;other is useless without the one. This is the harmonious cycle of&nbsp;Data and Control.</p>
  <p>Of themselves, Data and Control are without structure. The programmers&nbsp;of old moulded their programs out of this raw substance. Over time,&nbsp;the amorphous Data has crystallised into data types, and the chaotic&nbsp;Control was restricted into control structures and functions.</p>
  <h2>Short Sayings</h2>
  <p>When a student asked Fu-Tzu about the nature of the cycle of Data and&nbsp;Control, Fu-Tzu replied ‘Think of a compiler, compiling itself.’&nbsp;A student asked ‘The programmers of old used only simple machines and&nbsp;no programming languages, yet they made beautiful programs. Why do we&nbsp;use complicated machines and programming languages?’. Fu-Tzu replied&nbsp;‘The builders of old used only sticks and clay, yet they made&nbsp;beautiful huts.’</p>
  <p>A hermit spent ten years writing a program. ‘My program can compute&nbsp;the motion of the stars on a 286-computer running MS DOS’, he proudly&nbsp;announced. ‘Nobody owns a 286-computer or uses MS DOS anymore.’,&nbsp;Fu-Tzu responded.</p>
  <p>Fu-Tzu had written a small program that was full of global state and&nbsp;dubious shortcuts. Reading it, a student asked ‘You warned us against&nbsp;these techniques, yet I find them in your program. How can this be?’&nbsp;Fu-Tzu said ‘There is no need to fetch a water hose when the house is&nbsp;not on fire.</p>
  <p>‘{This is not to be read as an encouragement of sloppy&nbsp;programming, but rather as a warning against neurotic adherence to&nbsp;rules of thumb.}</p>
  <h2>Wisdom</h2>
  <p>A student was complaining about digital numbers. ‘When I take the root&nbsp;of two and then square it again, the result is already inaccurate!’.&nbsp;Overhearing him, Fu-Tzu laughed. ‘Here is a sheet of paper. Write down&nbsp;the precise value of the square root of two for me.’&nbsp;Fu-Tzu said ‘When you cut against the grain of the wood, much strength<br>
  is needed. When you program against the grain of a problem, much code&nbsp;is needed.’&nbsp;Tzu-li and Tzu-ssu were boasting about the size of their latest&nbsp;programs. ‘Two-hundred thousand lines’, said Tzu-li, ‘not counting&nbsp;comments!’. ‘Psah’, said Tzu-ssu, ‘mine is almost a *million* lines already.’ Fu-Tzu said ‘My best program has five hundred lines.’<br>
  Hearing this, Tzu-li and Tzu-ssu were enlightened.</p>
  <p>A student had been sitting motionless behind his computer for hours,&nbsp;frowning darkly. He was trying to write a beautiful solution to a<br>
  difficult problem, but could not find the right approach. Fu-Tzu hit&nbsp;him on the back of his head and shouted ‘*Type something!*’ The student&nbsp;started writing an ugly solution. After he had finished, he suddenly&nbsp;understood the beautiful solution.</p>
  <h2>Progression</h2>
  <p>A beginning programmer writes his programs like an ant builds her&nbsp;hill, one piece at a time, without thought for the bigger structure.<br>
  His programs will be like loose sand. They may stand for a while, but&nbsp;growing too big they fall apart<br>
  <span style="line-height: 1.5;">{Referring to the danger of internal&nbsp;inconsistency and duplicated structure in unorganised code.}.&nbsp;</span></p>
  <p>Realising this problem, the programmer will start to spend a lot of&nbsp;time thinking about structure. His programs will be rigidly&nbsp;structured, like rock sculptures. They are solid, but when they must&nbsp;change, violence must be done to them{Referring to the fact that&nbsp;structure tends to put restrictions on the evolution of a program.}.</p>
  <p>The master programmer knows when to apply structure and when to leave&nbsp;things in their simple form. His programs are like clay, solid yet&nbsp;malleable.</p>
  <h2>Language</h2>
  <p>When a programming language is created, it is given syntax and&nbsp;semantics. The syntax describes the form of the program, the semantics&nbsp;describe the function. When the syntax is beautiful and the semantics&nbsp;are clear, the program will be like a stately tree. When the syntax is&nbsp;clumsy and the semantics confusing, the program will be like a bramble&nbsp;bush.</p>
  <p>Tzu-ssu was asked to write a program in the language called Java,&nbsp;which takes a very primitive approach to functions. Every morning, as&nbsp;he sat down in front of his computer, he started complaining. All day&nbsp;he cursed, blaming the language for all that went wrong. Fu-Tzu&nbsp;listened for a while, and then reproached him, saying ‘Every language<br>
  has its own way. Follow its form, do not try to program as if you&nbsp;were using another language.’</p>
