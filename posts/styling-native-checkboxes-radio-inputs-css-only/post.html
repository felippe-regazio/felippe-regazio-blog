  So, do you want to style native radio and checkboxes without relying on JavaScript, plugins or dozens of wrappers, 
  is that right? Well, thats possible :)
</p>

<p>
  The provider of all that magic is the appearance css property. The appearance is used to apply or remove a 
  system-native style to/from a web element.
</p>

<p>
  Here's a link to know more about: <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/appearance.">

  </a>
</p>

<p>
  But if you take a look on the 'Can i use' you may note that this property is only well supported when setting 
  its value to "none", and thats exactly what we need . This is because the different apperance values may show 
  different results depending on your system and browser engine, but all the browsers suport the appearance:none 
  very well because there is no secret, it just removes the element native style. So, for that purpose, we have 
  a good support.

  Another thing that worth to say: The appearance cares ONLY about the element style. That means that if i set 
  appearance: none to a checkbox, the element is still a checkbox, but without any appearance (system style). 
  The opposite is also valid, giving an element appearance: button, for example, will not turn that element in a 
  button, the element will only have the button appearance.
</p>

<p>
  This is how we must use this property.
</p>

<pre>
  <code class="language-scss">
  .element {
    appearance: none;
    -moz-appearance: none;
    -webkit-appearance: none;
  }    
  </code>
</pre>

<h2>Coding</h2>

<p>
  Now lets code. The idea its very simple, we will remove the checkbox and radio inputs native style and 
  apply our own. If the browser doesn't support the appearance selector there is no harm, the native checkboxes 
  and radios will be used instead. This is the result:
</p>

<iframe 
  frameborder="0"
  style="width: 100%; height: 500px;"
  src="https://codepen.io/felipperegazio/full/vYOpJvb" 
></iframe>

<p>
  First lets remove the checkboxes and radios appearance
</p>

<pre>
  <code class="language-html">
  [type=radio],
  [type=checkbox] {
      -webkit-appearance: none;
      -moz-appearance:    none;
      appearance:         none;
  }    
  </code>
</pre>

<p>
  Now we will apply our appearance. You can combine the above properties and this ones in a single selector, 
  but lets split it to the sake of the post:
</p>

<pre>
  <code class="language-html">
  [type=radio],
  [type=checkbox] {
    width: 20px;
    height: 20px;
    border: solid 1px #cccccc;
    margin-right: 8px;
    position: relative;
  }    
  </code>
</pre>

<p>
  Now lets say how we want our elements to be when they are checked. Remember: we removed the appearance, 
  not the behavior. The ideia here is, when the element is checked we will use a ::before (pseudo-element) 
  to fill the empty space. Thats why our element is setted to position: relative, because the ::before will 
  be absolutely placed inside it, giving the "checked" appearance.
</p>

<pre>
  <code class="language-html">
  [type=radio]:checked::before,
  [type=checkbox]:checked::before {
    content: "";
    width: 14px;
    height: 14px;
    background-color: #ffa500;
    position: absolute;
    top: 2px;
    left: 2px;
  }    
  </code>
</pre>

<p>
  And finally, lets round the radio corners to differentiate them from the checkboxes:
</p>

<pre>
  <code class="language-html">
  [type=radio],
  [type=radio]:checked::before{
    border-radius: 100%;
  }    
  </code>
</pre>
